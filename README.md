# RVHD ( RANDOM VALUE HEALTH DASHBOARD )
This project is a health dashboard that could indicate your health datas such as 
* Heart rate
* BMI
* Blood pressure
* Stress level
* etc

This project is believed to achieve the third SDG goal : Good Health and Well-being

# Why we created this project?

This project is presented to you because most of the health indicators are on an expensive price , which is not affordable by the poor ones.Besides that , most of them are sold separately and only have one function.

But our project , RVHD , could provide most of the common and useful functions to our client at an affordable and reasonable price.

# Future Improvements
* Add Calorific Value indicator
* Publish user profile switching function
* Web server to view datas anywhere , anytime
